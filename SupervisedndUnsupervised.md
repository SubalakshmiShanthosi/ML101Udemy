# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning 


1. Scikit-Learn - no neural network description in diagram 

2. Supervised Learning 
 
           1. Linear features - Linear Regression
           2. Polynomial feature values - Logistic Regression and SVM
           
3. Supervised Learning - Classification 
         
           1. K-means clustering
           2. kNN
          
 4. Supervised Learning 
 
                   Task is well defined
                   Experience is there as training data is in the hands collected  by humans
                   Performance Metrics are measurable

 5. Unsupervised Learning 
                   
                   Task is vaguely defined
                   No prior experience 
                   No performance metrics - but accuracy score is present
