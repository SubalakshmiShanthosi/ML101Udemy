# Machine Learning  Process - Scikit-Learn Introduction 

1. Start collecting data.

2. Less than 50 records look for more data.

3. Find the type of Problem -
               
               1. Classification based on a category (labeled data)
               2. Clustering based on the quantity.
    

4. SVM - linear 
   Non Linear - Naive Bayes(Textual) , Ensemble on Approximation model 
   
 
5. Clustering - 
                  Number of categories less than 10K - k-means
                  Else
                  Mean shift 
   
6. Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
                  Component - Feature which we are looking for is known in prior
               
7. Regression on less features (continuous)

8. More Features and Regression - Dimensionality Reduction

9. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
